# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 8, 2018
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Started 100 days of code.

**Thoughts:** Advice/Rules say online courses and turorials don't count but also encourages users to tackle Free Code Camp as  place to start. Going to get back to working on Front End Cert for FCC (but need to keep doing course).
